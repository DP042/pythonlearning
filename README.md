    equal to (==)
    not equal to (!=)
    less than (<)
    less than or equal to (<=)
    greater than (>)
    greater thanor equal to (>=) 
Note that == compares whether two things are equal, and = assigns a value to a variable.  
** can be read as 'to the power of'. 3**/16 is about 43 million.
Comparisons result in either True or False, which are booleans.

# Boolean operators 
    compare statements and result in boolean values. There are three boolean operators:
    
    and, which checks if both the statements are True;
    or, which checks if at least one of the statements is True;
    not, which gives the opposite of the statement.
    
    Boolean operators aren’t just evaluated from left to right. Just like with arithmetic operators, there’s an order of operations for boolean operators:

    not is evaluated first;
    and is evaluated next;
    or is evaluated last.
    For example, True or not False and False returns True. If this isn’t clear, look at the Hint.
    Parentheses () ensure your expressions are evaluated in the order you want. Anything in parentheses is evaluated as its own unit.
